In this concept, LIBS measures the elemental spectroscopic emissions of the feedstock while it is flowing over a belt or being transported in a pneumatic line. 
The spectrum is then processed by ML (AI Engine in above drawing) algorithms which produces the final data to be used by either the plant operators or by a feedback or feedforward automatic control system. 
Examples of AI applications to LIBS analysis include using random forest (RF), artificial neural networks (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM).
There are also particular examples of AI applications to fuel-related analyses by LIBS, which include classification of coal ash using independent component analysis-wavelet neural network
(ICA-WNN), Kernel-based extreme learning machine (K-ELM) and variable-Wootton, Sergent, Phan-Tan-Luu's (V-WSP) algorithm and wrapper method particle swarm optimization (PSO).
